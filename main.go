// agentic-preview raises header-routed previews by talking to the telepresence
// traffic-manager's gRPC API directly. No telepresence CLI, no connector
// daemon, no TUN device, no root, no laptop: it runs as an ordinary Deployment
// and a pipeline drives it over HTTP.
//
// One call does the whole job. Given an image reference it BUILDS the preview -
// by copying the live Deployment, image swapped, so that everything the pod
// needs to run comes across rather than being invented - creates a Service in
// front of it, and then routes the header to it. See workload.go.
//
// It is long-lived by necessity rather than by choice. InterceptSpec.target_host
// reads like an address the traffic-agent connects to, but the agent never
// dials it: for each intercepted request it opens a tunnel back to the CLIENT
// session and sends the address down it, and the dial happens at the client's
// end. So the destination of a preview is not a value handed to the manager -
// it is a process holding a session and answering dial requests. Put that
// process in the cluster and a plain net.Dial reaches any ClusterIP.
